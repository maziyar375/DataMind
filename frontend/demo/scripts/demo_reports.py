"""The demo's reports: outlines a person approved, run for real, written from the rows.

A report is sections of blocks — each block one question, one statement, one
rendering — and a paragraph per section written from that section's results.
`build.py` runs every block through the guard and the connector and plans its
chart or big number with the backend's own `_chart` / `_kpi`, then checks each
paragraph the way the report worker does (`workers/report._numeric_check`): a
sentence citing block 2 may only state figures block 2's writer was given. The
executive summary is checked against the sections' prose, since that is all the
summary writer is shown.

Both reports are over the Sales warehouse. Sakila's policy is AGGREGATE, and
reports refuse NONE and AGGREGATE outright: a document written about values
the writer was never shown would be a document of guesses.

The prose is a function of the results, like every narrative in the demo, and
asserts the shape it describes, so moving `DEMO_TODAY` cannot ship a paragraph
that stopped being true.
